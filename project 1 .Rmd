## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Data Exploration

```{r}
ERdogs <- read_csv("ERdogs.csv")
head(ERdogs)
str(ERdogs)
ERdogs <- drop_na(ERdogs, 'Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above')
ERdogs <- drop_na(ERdogs, 'Patient  Pain rating based on image above')
ERdogs <- drop_na(ERdogs, 'Patient  Depression rating based on image above')
ERdogs.subset <- dplyr::select(ERdogs, 'Record ID', Age, Gender, Group, 'Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above', 'Patient  Pain rating based on image above', 'Patient  Depression rating based on image above')
head(ERdogs.subset)
summary(ERdogs.subset)
ERdogs.subset2 <- group_by(ERdogs.subset, Group)
summarize(ERdogs.subset2,'Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above',mean('Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above', na.rm = TRUE))

#Convert numeric to factor
ERdogs$`Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above`<- as.factor(ERdogs$`Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above`)
ERdogs$`Patient  Depression rating based on image above`<- as.factor(ERdogs$`Patient  Depression rating based on image above`)
ERdogs$`Patient  Pain rating based on image above`<- as.factor(ERdogs$`Patient  Pain rating based on image above`)
#Check to see that it converted 
str(ERdogs$`Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above`)
str(ERdogs$`Patient  Depression rating based on image above`)
str(ERdogs$`Patient  Pain rating based on image above`)

```

##Data Visualization

```{r}
#Bar plots showing these variables as factors with 11 levels 
ggplot(ERdogs) +
  aes(x = `Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above`) 
```


```{r}
geom_bar() +
  theme_cowplot()+
  xlab("Anxiety Rating") + 
  ylab("Number of Participants")

ggplot(ERdogs) +
  aes(x = `Patient  Depression rating based on image above`) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_cowplot()+
  xlab("Depression Rating") + 
  ylab("Number of Participants")

ggplot(ERdogs) +
  aes(x = `Patient  Pain rating based on image above`) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_cowplot()+
  xlab("Pain Rating") + 
  ylab("Number of Participants")

ggplot(ERdogs) +
  aes(x = `Patient  Pain rating based on image above`, color = Group, fill = Group) +
  geom_bar(binwidth = 0.5, position = "dodge") +
  theme_cowplot()

ggplot(ERdogs) +
  aes(x = `Patient  Anxiety rating based on image above`, color = Group, fill = Group) +
